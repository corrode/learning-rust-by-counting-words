His name was Gaal Dornick and he was just a country boy who had never seen Trantor before.
That is, not in real life. He had seen it many times on the hyper-video, and occasionally in
tremendous three-dimensional newscasts covering an Imperial Coronation or the opening of a
Galactic Council. Even though he had lived all his life on the world of Synnax, which circled a
star at the edges of the Blue Drift, he was not cut off from civilization, you see. At that time, no
place in the Galaxy was.
There were nearly twenty-five million inhabited planets in the Galaxy then, and not one but
owed allegiance to the Empire whose seat was on Trantor. It was the last halfcentury in which
that could be said.
